# Homework 1: Wikipedia

This homework has three parts.

- Part 1 explores data input, cleaning, and validation through
  data about world population in various countries.

- Part 2 asks you to structure a data processing application using Python
  classes.

- Part 3 is your initial project proposal.
  (Like the rest of the homeworks in this class, homework 1 comes with a project component).
  For this homework, the task is mostly lightweight.
  It will ask you to determine a hypothesis,
  guide through 10 questions about the scope of your project,
  and ask you to manually collect a small sample dataset of 10 data points.

## Getting Started

This homework will be submitted through GitHub Classroom.
You can find the instructions to join the classroom and accept the assignment on Piazza.
Clone your repository,
then open up and complete `part1.py`, `part2.py`, and `part3.py`.

If you get stuck, you can take a look at `hints.md` or consult Piazza.

## Grading Notes

In order to receive credit for your work, please follow the following guidelines.

- Make sure that `python3 part1.py`, `python3 part2.py`, and `python3 part3.py` run successfully with no errors, and the same for
`pytest part1.py`, `pytest part2.py`, and `pytest part3.py`.
We cannot give credit to code that doesn't run.

- Unless explicitly stated, don't rename any functions or methods or change the function signatures ("signature" means the number of arguments and the argument names).

- Make sure that the file `answers.csv` is filled in with your answers to each part.

- Make sure that you `git commit` and `git push` your latest code to your personal repository. This is how you will "submit" your code. Go to `github.com/<your repository link>` online to see if the changes are there; if you see the latest, most up-to-date version, then you are good to go.

- Lastly, as discussed in the syllabus, a small number of points on each homework (at most 10% of the grade) are reserved for style points. Here are some thoughts to consider: are your variable names chosen appropriately? Have you added comments with `#` or docstrings with `"""` where appropriate? Have you removed any obsolete, unused code blocks, functions, or variables?
